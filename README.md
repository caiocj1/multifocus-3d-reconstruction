# 3D Reconstruction from Multi-Focus Microscopic Images

This repository builds on the work of Takahiro Yamaguchi (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-39770-8_6)
and Sanchayan Santra, which aims to reconstruct 3D models of cells from
multi-focus microscopic images.

To run training on sample, `python main.py -m <model_name> -i <input_imgs_path>`
